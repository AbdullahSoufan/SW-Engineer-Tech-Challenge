## Questions

**1. What were the reasons for your choice of API/protocol/architectural style used for the client-server communication?**
I used Restful APIs architectural style for the client server communication because it is easy to use and more flexible
and it doesn't require an expensive tools in order of interaction between client and server. Also, it is more effcient
faster, with less processing required. Finally, Works on top of the HTTP transport so it takes advantage of HTTPs capabilities such
as get,post,...etc.




**2.  As the client and server communicate over the internet in the real world, what measures would you take to secure the data transmission and how would you implement them?**

 1- Encrypt the data : Like website encryption using SSL. Also, the use of different Encryption protocols
 2- Using SFTP : safest way to transfer data.
 3- Using Firewalls: So i can prevent any virus or hacking attacks and monitor network traffic.
 4- Cloud services is a good choice because most of cloud services uses high security protocols.
 5- Back up the data: in case of something happened it is always a good choice so save a copy of the data.
